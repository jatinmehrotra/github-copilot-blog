>Good Evening passengers. This is your captain speaking. First I'd like to welcome everyone on today's flight with my Github Copilot. **We are currently cruising at an altitude and airspeed where we get suggestions for whole lines and entire functions**. The code looks good and with the copilot on our side we are expecting to finish our code in approximately fifteen minutes ahead of schedule. The code in our JS is clear, tested and ofcourse free of bugs. With the help of copilot we can definitely code confidently in unfamilar territory without looking into docs. The cabin crew will be coming around in about every lines and comment to offer you the best possible suggestion. Until then, sit back, relax and enjoy the rest of the flight.

## What is GitHub Copilot?
**We all love weekend but this Friday was definitely different, surprising and overwhelming with happiness, because finally got my hands on GitHub Copilot.**

As a developer, our primary objective is to be efficient and agile with the changes in upcoming technology. But trying to code in a new language or unfamiliar framework has its own toll of consuming efforts either by looking into docs or searching through the web.

**Even at this time, Copilot is helping me to get a head start in writing this blog. I am using it to write about my journey in this field and to share my experiences with the community.** - NOT MY WORDS MY COPILOT IS TOO SMART!

It would be delusional to think that Copilot is just a mere auto-suggestion tool, however in my view `it's one of your teammate who knows everything on the web, sitting right beside you, understanding your context line by line and giving you
the best suggestions.`

### How to install?

A simple 3 step process :

- Search for the [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
- install it.
- Sign in to Github and Authorize it.

**Note :-** Copilot is in preview phase and is not yet available for public.

## Let's Fly!

As a backend Developer, setting up express server, get routes and middleware is a must. Lets Test whether Copilot is working or not.

- Initializing Repository with npm init and installing express package from npm npm i express
- Do some slight import so that GitHub Copilot knows what libraries we are using.



Till then, **Happy Learning!** %
